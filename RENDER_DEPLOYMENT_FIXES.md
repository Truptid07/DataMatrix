# Render Deployment Fixes

This document details the changes made to fix the Render deployment issues for DataMatrix Excel Analytics Platform.

## üõ†Ô∏è Fixed Issues

### 1. Directory Structure & Start Command

**Problem:** The original `render.yaml` had an incorrect start command path.

**Solution:**
- Added `rootDir: server` to the `render.yaml` configuration
- Modified the start command to run from the correct directory
- Corrected build command to ensure proper dependency installation

### 2. MongoDB Connection

**Problem:** MongoDB connection was potentially failing or timing out.

**Solution:**
- Updated MongoDB URI to specifically include the database name (`test`)
- Enhanced the MongoDB connection error handling
- Added detailed database connection logging
- Created debugging tools for connection diagnosis

### 3. Environment Variables

**Problem:** Environment variables might not be properly loaded.

**Solution:**
- Added server/.env file for direct use in the server directory
- Made the deploy-check.js more permissive in production
- Added better environment variable validation and fallbacks

### 4. Error Handling

**Problem:** Server was exiting early without proper error logs.

**Solution:**
- Added global error handlers for uncaught exceptions
- Added unhandled promise rejection handling
- Enhanced logging throughout the application
- Created detailed diagnostic scripts
